# Text to Ascii

This repo converts text to ascii art using FIGlet

# How to see the art

Run `node main.js` or `npm start` after changing `const stringToPrint` to your desired string. Once the `{stringToPrint}.txt` file is created, you want to zoom out on the file to see all the ascii art generated

# To do

Create a function that once the user knows the font they prefer, it will give you the art in a txt file
